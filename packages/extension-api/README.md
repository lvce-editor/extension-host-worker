# @lvce-editor/api

Extension API for Lvce Editor extensions.

```sh
npm install @lvce-editor/api
```

```ts
import { activate, registerCommand } from '@lvce-editor/api'

export const main = () => {
  activate()
  registerCommand({
    id: 'example.hello',
    execute() {
      console.log('Hello from an extension')
    },
  })
}
```

The package is published as unbundled ESM with TypeScript declaration files, so extensions can bundle it with their own build tooling.
